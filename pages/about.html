                                Hello! My name is Jonah Pearce, and I am a 28 year old Bay Area based Front-End Web Developer. For many years
                                I studied, volunteered, and worked as a Firefighter in the state of California and after some hard
                                thought decisions, I took my life in a new direction. Over the past few years I returned to school
                                and recieved an Associate's Degree in Computer Information Sciences with a concentration in App Development
                                and started looking towards the future. To improve upon and develop my skills and knowledge, I enrolled into
                                <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Codecademy</a> and set my sights on becoming a Front-End Developer.
                                Ever since then I have started dedicating my mind to developing projects based on Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

                                In my free time, I enjoy spending time with the animals in my life. 
                                My girlfriend Paige and I have adopted 2 pet rats during the pandemic 
                                named Mortimer and Ozwald, or Morty and Ozzy for short. 
                                We spend a lot of time making sure they have the best toys, play palaces, 
                                and dig boxes they could ever want. We also just recently began to live with Max, 
                                a Catahoula Leopard Dog that's more worm than dog. And finally 2 Boston Terriers, Ditto
                                and Oddish, whom we regularly babysit and probably spoil.

                                During the pandemic I reengaged with my love for tabletop games, most notably 
                                Dungeons and Dragons. Through some luck I reconnected with some old friends of 
                                mine who had happened to still be playing a campaign that we originally started 
                                when I was in middle-school. And from that moment on I fell in love all over again.
                                Now I continue to engage by playing in 2 campaigns connected to that same world and 
                                even starting a campaign myself as a new Dungeon Master. Learning the ins and outs of
                                the game and developing the ability of world building has helped me maintain and sharpen
                                my attention for detail as well as improving my sense of organization.

                                Thanks to my Firefighting background, I have developed a love of
                                hiking. In the past Paige began to love it as well when
                                she backcountry backpacked with her mother throughout the Sierras. In 
                                recent months, Paige and I have begun to take our first backpacking
                                trips together. We spent some time hiking together in the Emigrant Wilderness 
                                admiring the lush green meadows, babbling rivers, and towering mountain peaks.
                                And even more recently we traveled with the 
                                <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/san-francisco-bay/hiking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                                Sierra Hiking Club</a> traversing 31 miles and 15,000 feet in elevation through the
                                Sequoia National Forest. Although the hiking was tough, the views made it all the more 
                                worthwhile, from camping at secluded lakes every night to gazing down at the valleys we 
                                just tramped through, I couldn't recommend it any higher.
